ARTICLE B.9—GENERAL PROVISIONS

B.9.1 Payment. Customer will pay each correct invoice no later than 30 days after receipt and will remit payment to the address stated on the invoice. Customers outside the United States will pay the authorized distributor's invoices in accordance with the authorized distributor's payment terms.

B.9.2 Feedback. Esri may freely use any feedback, suggestions, or requests for Product improvement that Customer provides to Esri.

B.9.3 Patents. Customer may not seek, and may not permit any other user to seek, a patent or similar right worldwide that is based on or incorporates any Products. This express prohibition on patenting will not apply to Customer's software and technology except to the extent that Products, or any portion thereof, are part of any claim or preferred embodiment in a patent application or a similar application.

B.9.4 Restrictions on Solicitation. Neither party will solicit for hire any employee of the other party who is associated with the performance of Services during the performance of the Services and for a period of 1 year thereafter. This does not restrict either party from publicly advertising positions for hire in newspapers, professional magazines, or Internet postings.

B.9.5 Taxes and Fees; Shipping Charges. Pricing of Esri Offerings and Services that Esri quotes to Customer is exclusive of any and all applicable taxes or fees including, but not limited to, sales tax, use tax, or value-added tax (VAT); customs, duties, or tariffs; shipping and handling charges; and vendor enrollment fees. Esri will add any fees that it is required to pay to the total amount of its invoice to Customer. Esri may include estimated taxes and shipping and handling charges in its quotations but may adjust these fees on invoicing. For Customers outside the United States, the authorized distributor may quote taxes or fees in accordance with its own policies.

B.9.6 Compliance Review. Customer will keep accurate and complete records and accounts pertaining to its compliance with its obligations under this Agreement. Esri or its authorized distributor may conduct a compliance review of these records and accounts with no less than 14 business days' written notice or may appoint an independent third party to conduct such a compliance review on its behalf. Customer will promptly correct any noncompliance identified during the compliance review. Neither Esri nor Esri's authorized distributor may conduct a compliance review of Customer within 12 months after the conclusion of any prior compliance review that does not reveal any material Customer noncompliance.

B.9.7 No Implied Waivers. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement is not a waiver of the provisions or of the right of such party thereafter to enforce that or any other provision.

B.9.8 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, (i) such provision will be reformed only to the extent necessary to make the intent of the language enforceable, and (ii) all other provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect.

B.9.9 Successor and Assigns. Customer will not assign, sublicense, or transfer Customer's rights or delegate Customer's obligations under this Agreement without Esri's and its authorized distributor's prior written consent, and any attempt to do so without consent will be void. This Agreement will be binding on the respective successors and assigns of the parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding, a contractor under contract to the government to deliver Products may assign this Agreement and Products acquired for delivery to its government customer upon written notice to Esri, provided the government customer assents to the terms of this Agreement. Upon mutual agreement, Esri's Affiliates may provide Services under the terms of this Agreement; in such cases, the Ordering Documents will identify the Affiliate as the party that provides the Services. Esri's authorized distributors are not Affiliates of Esri.

B.9.10 Survival of Terms. The Glossary of Terms and provisions of the following Articles of these General Terms and Conditions will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement: "Limited Warranties and Disclaimers," "Limitation of Liability," "Indemnifications," and "General Provisions."

B.9.11 US Government Customer. The Products are commercial items, developed at private expense, provided to Customer under this Agreement. If Customer is a US government entity or US government contractor, Esri licenses or provides subscriptions to Customer in accordance with this Agreement under FAR Subparts 12.211/12.212 or DFARS Subpart 227.7202. Esri Data and Online Services are licensed or subscribed under the same DFARS Subpart 227.7202 policy as commercial computer software for acquisitions made under DFARS. Products are subject to restrictions, and this Agreement strictly governs Customer's use, modification, performance, reproduction, release, display, or disclosure of Products. Agreement provisions that are inconsistent with federal law regulation will not apply. A US government Customer may transfer Software to any of its facilities to which it transfers the computer(s) on which it has installed such Software. If any court, arbitrator, or board holds that a US government Customer has greater rights to any portion of Products under applicable public procurement law, such rights will extend only to the portions affected. ArcGIS Online has been granted FedRAMP tailored low authorization but does not meet higher security requirements including those found in DFARS 252.239-7010.

B.9.12 Governing Law. This Agreement is not subject to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

a. Government Entities. If Customer is a government entity, the applicable laws of Customer's jurisdiction govern this Agreement.
b. Nongovernment Entities. US federal law and the law of the State of California exclusively govern this Agreement, excluding their respective choice of law principles.

B.9.13 Dispute Resolution. The parties will use the following dispute resolution processes:

a. Equitable Relief. Either party will have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without the requirement of posting a bond or proving injury as a condition for relief.
b. US Government Agencies. This Agreement is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 USC 601–613).
c. Other Government Entities. Esri will comply with mandatory dispute resolutions under applicable law.
d. Arbitration. Except as noted above, the parties will submit to binding arbitration to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement that cannot be settled through negotiation. If Customer is in the United States or one of its territories or outlying areas, the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association will govern the arbitration proceedings. If Customer is outside the United States, the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce will govern the proceedings. The parties will select a single arbitrator in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules. The language of the arbitration will be English. Arbitration will be at an agreed-upon location. Either party will, at the request of the other, make available documents or witnesses relevant to the major aspects of the dispute.

B.9.14 Force Majeure. A party will not be liable for any failure of or delay in the performance of this Agreement for the period that such failure or delay is due to causes beyond the party's reasonable control. Such causes may include, but are not limited to, acts of God, war, strikes, labor disputes, cyber attacks, laws, regulations, government orders, or any other force majeure event.

B.9.15 Independent Contractor. Esri is and at all times will be an independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement creates an employer/employee, principal/agent, or joint venture relationship between Esri or its authorized distributor and Customer. No party has any authority to enter into contracts on behalf of another party or otherwise act on behalf of another party.
